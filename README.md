Current hardware design is dominated by two languages, VHDL and Verilog,
which are about 30 years old. They have been originaly not designed for
hardware synthesis. Therefore, a lotmof constructs in the language cannot
be implemented in hardware and basic synthesizable constructs (combinational
logic, refisters, and memory) are are only 'infered' from code in a typical
style.

However, several projects take the active development of new languages for
classic softwa development and adapt it for hardware description langages (HDL).
This GitHub project is about getting an overview what is out on new tools and
trying to assess the pro and cons for individual languages.
