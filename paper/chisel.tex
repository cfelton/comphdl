\begin{abstract}
this paper is a collection of notes and comments on the Chisel HDL.
Maybe this will be useful for a future Chisel manual.

\section{Comments}

What does tick() and what does step() do for testing?
  vars in step are input, the output is either set by the test bench to compare to, or set by the component output values when not set in the test bench.
How get to inner signals on testing?
What is the meaning if isTrace?

val x = expr is an assignment.
val y = type is a forward declaration
y := expr is then the assignment, := is called the wiring operator

The waveform shows the input of an register, not the output.
The waveform shows IO signals and registers.
The waveform shows only IO signals that are in use.

Try out multiple wiring operations, setup test play around with print of output, may be no -vcd now

This is the way to get a printable output:

\begin{verbatim}
      step(svars, ovars, false)
      val out = ovars(c.io.out).litValue()
\end{verbatim}


What is the meaning of data in Reg? Is it the input signal?

What does a step() when testing combinational circuits? Just change the input values, right? Clock is simply ignored.

Test bench is mix of Chisel and Scala code. The hardware description needs plain Chisel, 'no Scala constructs'. Which are the forbidden Scala constructs?

Hardware that is not really used is optimized away for the simulation.
This might be just a little bit inconvenient when signals cannot be seen in
the waveform. However, this is very annoying when it results in C code
that connote be compiled.

1)What is a good way to monitor internal signals? for debugging

you can list the signals to monitor using the sequence args to Tester:

  class GCDTests(c: GCD) extends Tester(c, Array(c.io)) ...

where you just add extra nodes to the Array.  these will then appear in your ovars from calls to step:

Rewrite the above with the example talen from Patmos in chisel.
