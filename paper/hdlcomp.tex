Compare different HDLs.
\end{abstract}

\section{General}

Do some exploration of user base and available source code on all languages.

How many \emph{background} knowledge on programming language do we need for the new HDL?

Can it be a language to teach 1st and 2nd semester EE students to learn digital
electronics? Even without programming background? We now struggle with VHDL.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Assessment Criteria}


In synchronous design the two basic building blocks are combinational
(asynchronous) logic and flip-flop based registers. Larger on-chip
memories are not built out of registers, but are considered another building
block. This building blocks are also reflected in current FPGAs: lookup tables
(LUT) are used to implement combinational functions, dedicated flip-flops
the registers, on-chip memories support larger storage requirements,
and dedicated hard macros (with MAC operations) support efficient
implementation of DSP algorithms.

This results in following questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Is it clear what is combinational logic and what are registers?
\item Can FPGA block RAMs be instantiated? Can ROMs be used?
\item Can the DSP blocks be used?
\end{itemize}

\todo{Write some text around the questions as motivation for them}

Further questions to be answered:

\begin{itemize}
\item Is simulation in the HDL possible?
\item Is there a clear line between the synthsizable  and not synthsizable parts of the language?
\item Can it be used in a first semester digital electronics course?
\item Quality of generated code: hardware resources and maximum clock frequency
\item Mixed language (with VHDL and/or Verilog) usage?
\item Size of the user group and support
\item Active development
\end{itemize}

Missing and hard to assess: productivity, easy to maintain.

\section{Getting Started}

This is a first tour through the languages.

\subsection{MyHDL}

Starting with MyHDL was a pleasure. Having Python already installed, the installation
of MyHDL was a matter of minutes. Having been exposed to Python for about one
day before, the first examples from the MyHDL manual~\cite{myhdl:2010} where easy as well.
However, jumping ahead and trying to generate some real VHDL code and programming
an FPGA with the HW version of \emph{Hello World} took some hours struggling
with cryptic error messages. The author is used to statically typed languages and
compile checks, where Pythons dynamic typing and interpreting execution model
reveals program and even typing errors only at runtime needs some adaption of
the authors programming mindset and habits.

The development approach in MyHDL is to test and verify the hardware within Python first
before generating VHDL or Verilog. Therefore, basic Python language knowledge is
needed for MyHDL. In fact MyHDL is less a language in its own, but a Python package.

\todo{Maybe this goes into a Discussion section at the end}

The question is if a dynamic typed language, where a variable can change the type
at runtime, the best base for HW synthesis is. In the resulting Verilog/VHDL code and
in the hardware the type of a signal or a register is statically fixed. Type errors in
Python are only detected at runtime by extensive testing. In a statically typed
language the compiler finds all type errors at compile time.





\begin{itemize}
\item Very simple to download install
\item Python needs to be learned, some VHDL/Verilog knowledge is still needed
\end{itemize}

Installed on Python 2.7. Does it need a 2.x Python or would it run on 3.x as well?

How large is the user base on MyHDL? Any open-source projects?

see \url{http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.myhdl/2701}

\section{Language Assessments}

In this section we will assess which languages fulfill the criteria proposed in
the introduction and answer the questions.

\subsection{Is it clear what is combinational logic and what are registers?}

\todo{Check Verilog}

In VHDL there is no clear distinction between combinational logic, flip-flop
registers,  and memories in the language. Registers (and memories) are
inferred from \emph{code patterns}. Furthermore, small errors can result
in unintended latches generated in processes that are intended to be combinational.

MyHDL has no distinct types for register of memory. However, it uses annotations
(so called decorators in Python) to mark a function representing
combinational logic with \code{@always\_comb} and a function where the
output is stored in registers with \code{@always(clk.posedge)}. We consider
this as an enhancement related to VHDL/Verilog \todo{Check Verilog}.

\subsection{Documentation and Tutorials}

The MyHDL distribution 

\subsection{Active Community}

It is important that a new language has a active developer group that is
able to fix errors and incorporate changes when new (FPGA) technology
becomes available. Furthermore, an active forum for the language users
is beneficial for getting started.

MyHDL is developed and maintained by Jan Decaluwe with the help of
Christopher Felton.  

\section{Notes (from iPad/Dropbox)}

MyHDL

Having min and max values that cannot be implemented so in HW is strange. I would prefer just signed/unsigned with a power of 2 range.

MyHDL is not a new language, but a python package. Python is the language. If a HW description is embedded in a full blown general purpose language with a lot of libraries, how easy is it to see the boundaries of what is synthesizable hardware, what is test benches, unit tests, and even generator code?

There is no indication is parameters are input or output signals.

Testing looks convenient with all the Python support.

Are signal records/structures possible?

A dynamic (scripting) language depends very much on unit tests. Even typos are only
discovered when the code is executed. Static typed languages (such as Java
and Scala) can catch quite a lot of bugs and typos during compilation.

General

Is tri state supported?

Shall I look into C based HDLs?

SystemC?

SystemVerilog
