This a try to get the minimum build environment to start with Chisel.

The Chisel tutorial provides a framework with exercises and a lot
of automation to get started with Chisel examples. However, this
automation make it hard to see how the individual pieces fit together.
Therefore, this is a try to cut it doen to the minimum.

The example project consists of:

   src/Hello.scala       The source of a hardware description of an adder
   Makefile              drives the build process
   project/Build.scala   Configuration to download Chisel and for the Chisel project
   sbt/sbt-launch.jar    is the SBT build tool for Scala

The actual project configuration (files, folders, main entry,...) is
distributed in Build.scala and as parameters to Chisel in the Makefile.

Remarks and comments are distributed in the individual files.
